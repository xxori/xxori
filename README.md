## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick, an 18 year-old software developer studying Adv. Computer Science at the University of Adelaide. 

Looking to build things that help people and explore different paradigms of thinking such as functional programming, stack/array programming, and interactive theorem provers.

My most practical experience is in Python, Rust, and C, and I've made a few frontends with Javascript and Flutter before.

Feel free to reach out for a chat through my linked email me@pthompson.xyz or my discord (_oree) at any time.
