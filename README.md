## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patrick, and 18 year-old software developer studying Adv. Computer Science at the University of Adelaide. Looking to build things that help people and explore different paradigms of thinking such as functional programming (Haskell/Erlang), stack/array programming (Uiua/J), and interactive theorem provers (Coq/Lean).

Feel free to reach out for a chat through my linked email me@pthompson.xyz or my discord (308034225137778698) at any time.
